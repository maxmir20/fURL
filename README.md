# fURL
Format your URL to declutter pesky marketing parameters (UTM, fbclid, etc.) with this lightweight browser extension!

UTM parameters are used by companies to track where they are being linked from (e.g. Instagram, FB, etc.). While this is useful for marketing purposes, they make link sharing ugly, leading to long messy. Link sharing UTM parameters can also confuse marketing campaigns if it's shared across mediums (e.g. a FB link is shared over WhatsApp). 

fURL takes the URL you've copied, removes any non-essential query parameters, and returns a link that still allows for content-previewing. fURL does not collect any data or store any information, and will never be used for monetary purposes.

Use Cases:

Copy from page:
if you copy anything from a webpage, fURL will automatically check if it's a relevant URL and will format it accordingly. 

Copy Address Bar:
If you would like to copy the url address bar, just click the fURL browser icon to the right of window.
